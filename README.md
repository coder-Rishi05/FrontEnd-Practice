# FrontEnd-Practice
<br><br>
I recently recreated the Frontend Practice homepage using only HTML & CSS, focusing on clean design and responsiveness. This project helped me refine my CSS structuring skills and improve my understanding of layout techniques. <br><br>

âœ¨ Project Highlights: <br>
âœ… Fully Responsive â€“ Ensures a seamless experience across all devices. <br>
âœ… Smooth Hover Effects â€“ Enhancing interactivity with subtle animations. <br>
âœ… Pure HTML & CSS â€“ No JavaScript or frameworks, just clean and structured code. <br>
âœ… Before & After Pseudo-Elements â€“ Used for decorative elements and styling enhancements for buttons and navbar. <br><br>

This challenge was a great way to practice flexbox, pseudo-elements, and responsiveness, reinforcing my ability to create pixel-perfect UI designs. <br><br>
